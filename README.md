Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS) attacks are a subclass of denial of service (DoS) attacks. A DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack involves multiple connected online devices, collectively known as a botnet, which is used to overwhile a target website or network with excessive traffic, rendering it inaccessible. Originating in the late 1980s, significant DDOS attacks emerged in the early 2000s. Notable incidents include the 2016 Mirai botnet attack and the 2020 Amazon Web Services outage due to DDOS.
